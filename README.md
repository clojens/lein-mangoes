# lein-mangoes

A build system for client ide development.

## Usage

This plugin is not yet avalaible on clojars. Thus please clone the repo, and run `lein install` from the folder.

Put `[lein-mangoes "0.1.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

FIXME: and add an example usage that actually makes sense:

    $ lein jeff
